# @holokai/holo-provider-openai

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Add multi-capability SDK support: generate, embed, and metrics namespaces on HoloClient, generalized protocol resolution, auditor mapFinishReason/mapUsage with per-plugin overrides, and new holo-types for embed/generate/metrics/models.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Rename test-sdk to holo-test, move plugin loader to holo-sdk, add ProviderProtocol and StreamEventSequence types, add streamEventSequence to all plugin CHAT routes, add live integration test infrastructure.

## 1.3.2

### Patch Changes

- a0062e7: Restructure packages: rename @holokai/sdk → @holokai/holo-sdk, @holokai/types → @holokai/holo-types. Delete packages/lib (event processor moved to holo-sdk). Merge test-harness + test-utils into test-sdk. Add moku-sdk and moku-types packages. Update all imports across app and plugins.

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- d813d15: Reorganize monorepo: move shared packages to packages/ directory
  - Move types, sdk, lib, test-harness, test-utils from plugins/ to packages/
  - plugins/ now contains only provider plugins
  - Update workspace order: packages → plugins → app (correct build order)
  - Fix tsconfig paths in provider plugins (move inside compilerOptions)
  - Remove thread routes/controller/db and analytics routes/controller from gateway
  - Change type-check script to clean + rebuild (avoids stale tsbuildinfo issues)

- d813d15: Unify audit pipeline: HoloWorkerRequest as single audit record
  - Extract `WorkerEnvelopeBase` shared interface from request/response envelopes
  - Add optional `providerEvent` and `workerId` to `HoloWorkerRequest` so it serves as the single audit queue message
  - Pipeline no longer takes an `auditor` param — attaches terminal provider event and publishes to audit
  - Audit service reconstructs both request and response DB records from a single `logAuditRecord()` call
  - Consolidate to single audit queue consumer (remove separate request/response queues)
  - Delete dead code: `HoloWorkerResponse`, `WorkerResponseFactory`, legacy OpenAI chatcompletions service
  - Fix test fixtures: replace removed `LlmStatus` with `ProviderResponseStatus`, add missing metrics to audit-tester, fix OpenAI Responses API auditor for non-streaming message shape
  - Slim `PipelineResult` to `{ text: string }`

## 1.3.0

### Patch Changes

- update provider translators and auditors for SDK integration

## 1.2.2

### Patch Changes

- Add historical pricing datasets with compiled snapshot normalization
  - Add PricingDataset types and normalizePricingDataset() engine to SDK that compiles raw pricing snapshots into
    complete point-in-time sheets with model carry-forward, alias expansion, shutdown removal, and effective_to date
    ranges
  - Create historical pricing datasets for Claude (15 snapshots back to 2023-03), Gemini (7 snapshots back to
    2024-02), and OpenAI (12 snapshots back to 2023-06)
  - All plugins now implement getPricingSheets() returning full history; plugin service registers all sheets with
    effective_to for accurate historical cost calculation
  - Fix unhandled promise rejections in streaming paths for OpenAI, Gemini, and Ollama providers by deferring work
    into final() instead of starting floating IIFEs

## 1.2.1

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Pricing system, cache invalidation, `/holo/api` route prefix, model access checks, Claude SDK update.
  - Pricing system: plans, sheets, per-model token costs with bulk recalculation via CTE
  - Cache invalidation endpoints for Redis flush on application/provider updates
  - Moved Holo management APIs to `/holo/api` prefix to separate from provider routes
  - Model access validation in request pipeline
  - Updated Claude provider SDK and response translators
  - Plugin route and protocol type updates

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Adapted to plugin/protocol system with capability-based registration
- Protocol capability registration for `openai.completions` (chat) and `openai.embeddings` (embed)
- Wire adapter for OpenAI request/response translation
- Proper request/response auditing with metadata

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @holokai/holo-sdk@1.1.0

## 1.0.0

### Minor Changes

- Broke up SDK to have dependency-less @holokai/holo-types. Reorganized types and interfaces. Fixed up some types vs
  interfaces. Prefixed true interfaces that are used to describe classes vs TypeScript interfaces used to just describe
  an object.

### Patch Changes
